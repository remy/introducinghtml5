__ALTHougH__ __MucH__ __oF__ the attention that HTML5 has received revolves around the new APIs, there is a great deal to interest markup monkeys as well as JavaScript junkies. There are 30 new elements with new semantics that can be used in traditional "static" pages. There is also a swathe of new form controls that can abolish JavaScript form validation altogether.

So, let's get our hands dirty. In this chapter, we'll transform the current markup structure of <div>s into a semantic system. New HTML5 structural elements like <nav>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, and <article> designate specific types of content. We'll look at how these work, and how HTML5 documents have an unambiguous outline and are--arguably--more "semantic."

The <head>

First things first: the DOCTYPE:

<!DOCTYPE html>

That's it. No unwieldy string that even the most prolific web authors need to cut and paste. No URLs. No version number. That's all. It's not so much an instruction as an incantation: it's required by browsers that need the presence of a DOCTYPE to trigger standards mode, and this is the shortest string that does this reliably. We've written in uppercase so that it's both HTML and XML compliant, and suggest you do the same.

Then we need to define the document's character encoding. Not doing so can result in an obscure but real security risk (see[ http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/__ArticleUtf7__]( http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/__ArticleUtf7__)). This should be in the first 512 bytes of the document. Unless you can think of a splendid reason not to use it, we recommend UTF-8 as the character encoding:

<!DOCTYPE html> <meta charset=utf-8>

Take a look at that <meta> tag very carefully. Those who are accustomed to writing XHTML will notice three oddities. The first is that the <meta> tag is much shorter than the tag we are familiar with--<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">. This is still possible, but the shorter way is better as it's easier to type and works everywhere already.

You'll also notice that I haven't quoted the attribute charset="utf-8". Neither have I self-closed the tag <meta charset=utf-8 />.

HTML5 is not an XML language, so you don't need to do those things. But you can if you prefer. All of these are equally valid HTML5:

<META CHARSET=UTF-8> <META CHARSET=UTF-8 /> <META CHARSET="UTF-8"> <META CHARSET="UTF-8" /> <meta charset=utf-8> <meta charset=utf-8 /> <__meTa__ __CHARset__="utf-8"> <__meTa__ __CHARset__="utf-8" />

Pick a style and stick with it

Just because you can use any of the aforementioned syntaxes doesn't mean you should mix them all up, however. That would prove a maintenance nightmare, particularly in a large team.

Our advice is to pick a style that works for you and stick with it. It doesn't matter which you choose; Remy prefers XHTML syntax while Bruce prefers lowercase, attribute minimisation (so controls rather than controls="controls") and only quoting attributes when it's necessary, as in adding two classes to an element--so <div class=important> but <div class="important logged-in">. You'll see both styles in this book, as we each work as we feel most comfortable and you need to be able to read both.

As a brave new HTML5 author, you're free to choose--but having chosen, keep to it.

{{figure 1.1
Figure 1.1 Shockingly, with no head, body, or HTML tag, the document validates.
}}

Why such appallingly lax syntax? The answer is simple: browsers never cared about XHTML syntax if it was sent as text/html-- only the XHTML validator did. Therefore, favouring one form over the other in HTML5 would be entirely arbitrary, and cause pages that didn't follow that format to be invalid, although they would work perfectly in any browser. So HTML5 is agnostic about which you use.

While we're on the subject of appallingly lax syntax rules (from an XHTML perspective), let's cheat and, after adding the document title, go straight to the content:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<meta charset=utf-8>

<title>Interesting blog</title>

<p>Today I drank coffee for breakfast. 14 hours later, ¬I went to bed.</p>

If we validate this exhilarating blog, we find that it validates fine, yet it has no <html> tag, no <head>, and no <body> (Figure 1.1).

{{figure 1.2
Figure 1.2 Opera Dragonfly debugger shows that browsers add the missing elements.
}}

This is perhaps one of those WTF? moments I mentioned in the introduction. These three elements are (XHTML authors, are you sitting down?) entirely optional, because browsers assume them anyway. A quick glance under the browser hood with Opera Dragonfly confirms this (Figure 1.2).

{{figure 1.3
Figure 1.3 shows it using the Internet Explorer 6 developer tools.
}}

{{figure 1.3
Figure 1.3 Internet Explorer 6, like all other browsers, adds missing elements in the DOM. (Old versions of IE seem to swap <title> and <meta>, however.)
}}

Because browsers do this, HTML5 doesn't require these tags. Nevertheless, omitting these elements from your markup

is likely to confuse your coworkers. Also, if you plan to use __AppCache__ (see Chapter 7) you'll need the <html> element in your markup. It's also a good place to set the primary language of the document:

<html lang=en>

A visually-impaired user might come to your website with screenreading software that reads out the text on a page in a synthesized voice. When the screenreader meets the string "six" it will pronounce it very differently if the language of the page is English or French. Screenreaders can attempt to guess at what language your content is in, but it's much better to unambiguously specify it, as I have here.

IE8 and below require the <body> element before they will apply CSS to style new HTML5 elements, so it makes sense to use this element, too.

So, in the interest of maintainability, we'll add those optional elements to make what's probably the minimum maintainable HTML5 page:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang=en>

<head>

<meta charset=utf-8> <title>Interesting blog</title> </head>

<body>

<p>Today I drank coffee for breakfast. 14 hours later, ¬I went to bed.</p>

</body>

</html>

Does validation matter anymore?

Given that we have such forgiving syntax, we can omit implied tags like <html>, <head>, and <body>, and--most importantly--because HTML5 defines a consistent DOM for any bad markup, you might be asking yourself if validation actually matters anymore. We've asked ourselves the same question.

Our opinion is that it's as important as it's ever been as a quality assurance tool. But it's only ever been a tool, a means to an end--not a goal in itself.

The goal is semantic markup: ensuring that the elements you choose define the meaning of your content as closely as possible, and don't describe presentation. It's possible to have a perfectly valid page made of nothing but display tables, divs, and spans, which is of no semantic use to anyone, Conversely, a single unencoded ampersand can make an excellently structured, semantically rich web page invalid, but it's still a semantic page.

When we lead development teams, we make passing validation a necessary step before any code review, let alone before making code live. It's a great way to ensure that your code really does what you want. After all, browsers may make a consistent DOM from bad markup but it might not be the DOM you want.

Also, HTML5 parsers aren't yet everywhere, so ensuring valid pages is absolutely what you should aim for to ensure predictable CSS and JavaScript behaviours.

We recommend using[ http://validator.w3.org/]( http://validator.w3.org/) or[ http://html5.validator.nu]( http://html5.validator.nu). We expect that there will be further developments in validators, such as options to enforce coding choices--so you can choose to be warned for not using XHTML syntax, for example, even though that's not required by the spec. One such tool that looks pretty good is[ http://lint.brihten.com]( http://lint.brihten.com), although we can't verify whether the validation routines it uses are up-to-date.

Using new HTML5 structural elements

TABLE 1.1 Class Names

In 2004, Ian Hickson, the editor of the HTML5 spec, mined

one billion web pages via the Google index, looking to see

what the "real" Web is made of. One of the analyses he subsequently published (http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/ classes.html) was a list of the most popular class names in those HTML documents.

More recently, in 2009, the Opera MAMA crawler looked again at class attributes in 2,148,723 randomly chosen URLs and also ids given to elements (which the Google dataset didn't include) in 1,806,424 URLs. See Table 1.1 and Table 1.2.

As you can see, once we remove obviously presentational classes, we're left with a good idea of the structures that authors are trying to use on their pages.

Just as HTML 4 reflects the early Web of scientists and engineers (so there are elements like <kbd>, <samp>, and <var>), HTML5 reflects the Web as it was during its development: 30 elements are new, many of them inspired by the class and id names above, because that's what developers build.

So, while we're in a pragmatic rather than philosophical mood, let's actually use them. Here is a sample blog home page marked up as we do in HTML 4 using the semantically neutral <div> element:

<div id="header">

<h1>My interesting life</h1>

</div>

<div id="sidebar">

 <h2>Menu</h2>

 <ul>

<li><a href="last-week.html">Last week</a></li>

<li><a href="archive.html">Archives</a></li> </ul>

</div>

<div class="post">

<h2>Yesterday</h2>

<p>Today I drank coffee for breakfast. 14 hours later, ¬I went to bed.</p>

</div>

<div class="post">

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Ran out of coffee, so had orange juice for breakfast. ¬It was from concentrate.</p>

</div>

<div id="footer">

<p><small> This is copyright by Bruce Sharp. Contact me to

¬negotiate the movie rights.</small></p> </div>

By applying some simple CSS to it, we'll style it:

#sidebar [{float:left;]({float:left;)[ width:20%;]( width:20%;)} .post [{float:right;]({float:right;)[ width:79%;]( width:79%;)} #footer [{clear:both;]({clear:both;)}

{{figure 1.4
Figure 1.4 The HTML 4 structure of our blog.
}}

Diagrammatically, the page looks like Figure 1.4. div id="header"

div class="post"

div id= "sidebar"

While there is nothing at all wrong with this markup (and it'll continue working perfectly well in the new HTML5 world), most of the structure is entirely unknown to a browser, as the only real HTML element we can use for these important page landmarks is the semantically neutral <div> (defined in HTML 4 as "a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents").

So, if it displays fine, what's wrong with this? Why would we want to use more elements to add more semantics?

It's possible to imagine a clever browser having a shortcut key that would jump straight to the page's navigation. The question is: How would it know what to jump to? Some authors write <div class="menu">, others use class="nav" or class="navigation"

or class="links" or any number of equivalents in languages other than English. The Opera MAMA tables above suggest that menu, nav, sidebar, and navigation could all be synonymous, but there's no guarantee; a restaurant website might use <div class="menu"> not as navigation but to list the food choices.

HTML5 gives us new elements that unambiguously denote landmarks in a page. So, we'll rewrite our page to use some of these elements:

<header>

<h1>My interesting life</h1>

</header>

<nav>

 <h2>Menu</h2>

 <ul>

<li><a href="last-week.html">Last week</a></li>

div class="post" div id="footer"

{{figure 1.5

}}

<li><a href="archive.html">Archives</a></li> </ul>

</nav>

<article>

<h2>Yesterday</h2>

<p>Today I drank coffee for breakfast. 14 hours later, ¬I went to bed.</p>

</article>

<article>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Ran out of coffee, so had orange juice for breakfast. ¬It was from concentrate.</p>

</article>

<footer>

<p><small>This is copyright by Bruce Sharp. Contact me to ¬negotiate the movie rights.</small></p>

</footer>

Diagrammatically, the HTML5 version is shown in Figure 1.5. header

nav

article

    article

footer

Before we look in detail at when to use these new elements and what they mean, let's first style the basic structures of the page.

10

Why, oh why, is there no <content> element?

It's easy to see how our hypothetical "jump to nav" shortcut key would work, but a more common requirement is to jump straight to the main content area. Some accessibility-minded designers add a "skip links" link at the very top of the page, to allow screen reader users to bypass navigation items. Wouldn't it be great if browsers provided a single keystroke that jumped straight to the main content?

Yet in HTML5 there is no <content> element to jump to, so how would the browser know where the main content of a page begins?

Actually, it's simple to determine where it is, using what I call the Scooby Doo algorithm. You always know that the person behind the ghost mask will be the sinister janitor of the disused theme park, simply because he's the only person in the episode who isn't Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, or Scooby. Similarly, the first piece of content that's not in a <header>, <nav>, <aside>, or <footer> is the beginning of the main content, regardless of whether it's contained in an <article>, or <div>, or whether it is a direct descendent of the <body> element.

This would be useful for screenreader users, and mobile device manufacturers could have the browser zoom straight in to the central content, for example.

If you're wishing there were a <content> element as a styling hook, you can use WAI-ARIA and add role=main to whatever element wraps your main content, which also provides a styling hook via CSS attribute selectors (not available in IE6), for example, div[role=main] [{float:right;]({float:right;)} (see Chapter 2 for more on WAI-ARIA).

Styling HTML5 with CSS

In all but one browser, styling these new elements is pretty simple: You can apply CSS to any arbitrary element, because, as the spec says, CSS "is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style . . . to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications)" and XML applications can have any elements you want.

Therefore, using CSS we can float <nav>, put borders on <header> and <footer>, and give margins and padding to <article> almost as easily as we can with <div>s.

Although you can use the new HTML5 elements now, older browsers don't necessarily understand them. They don't do anything special with them and they treat them like unknown elements you make up.

What might surprise you is that, by default, CSS assumes that elements are[ display:inline]( display:inline), so if you just set heights and widths to the structural elements as we do <div>s, it won't work

properly in ye olde browsers until we explicitly tell the browser that they are[ display:block]( display:block). Browsers contain a rudimentary, built-in style sheet that overrides the default inline styling for those elements we think of as natively block-level (one such style sheet can be found at[ http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/]( http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) sample.html). Older browsers don't have rules that define new HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <article> as[ display:block]( display:block), so we need to specify this in our CSS. For modern browsers, our line will be redundant but harmless, acting as a useful helper for older browsers, which we all know can linger on well beyond their sell-by dates.

So, to style our HTML5 to match our HTML 4 design, we simply need the styles

header, nav, footer, article [{display:block;]({display:block;)} nav [{float:left;]({float:left;)[ width:20%;]( width:20%;)}

article [{float:right;]({float:right;)[ width:79%;]( width:79%;)}

footer [{clear:both;]({clear:both;)}

And a beautiful HTML5 page is born. Except in one browser.

Styling HTML5 in Internet Explorer 6,7,8

In old (but sadly, not dead) versions of Internet Explorer, CSS is properly applied to the HTML 4 elements that IE does support, but any new HTML5 elements that the browser doesn't know remain unstyled. This can look . . . unpleasant.

The way to cajole old IE into applying CSS to HTML5 is to poke it with a sharp JavaScript-shaped stick. Why? This is an inscrutable secret, and if we told you we'd have to kill you. (Actually, we don't know.) If you add the following JavaScript into the head of the page

<script>

 document.__createElement__('header');

 document.__createElement__('nav');

 document.__createElement__('article');

 document.__createElement__('footer');

</script>

IE will magically apply styles to those elements, provided that there is a <body> element in the markup. You need only create each element once, no matter how many times it appears on a page.

Remember, HTML5 itself doesn't require a body element, but this heady brew of Internet Explorer 8 (and earlier versions),

12

> The <script> element no longer requires you to specify the type of script; JavaScript is assumed by default. This works on legacy browsers also so you can use it right away.

CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript does. IE9 works like the other browsers and doesn't need JavaScript.

Although this JavaScript is unnecessary for other browsers, it won't cause them any harm. However, you might wish to give your page a speed optimisation and only download and execute this script in IE by surrounding it with conditional comments (see[ http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/]( http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/) supporting-ie-with-conditional-comments/).

Enabling Script

Alternatively, you can use Remy's tiny HTML5-enabling script[ http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/]( http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/) that will perform this for all new elements in one fell swoop, and which also includes Jon Neal's IE Print Protector (http://www.iecss.com/print-protector) that ensures that HTML5 elements also appear styled correctly when printing documents in IE.

A user with JavaScript turned off, whether by choice or corporate security policy, will be able to access your content but will see a partially styled or unstyled page. This may or may not be a deal-breaker for you. (A user with ancient IE and no JavaScript has such a miserable web experience, your website is unlikely to be the worst they encounter.) Simon Pieters has shown

that, if you know what the DOM looks like, you can style some HTML5 without JavaScript but it's not particularly scalable or maintainable; see "Styling HTML5 markup in IE without script" at[ http://blog.whatwg.org/styling-ie-noscript]( http://blog.whatwg.org/styling-ie-noscript).

Other legacy browser problems

There are other legacy browser problems when styling HTML5. Older versions of Firefox (prior to version 3) and Camino (before version 2) had a bug that[ http://html5doctor.com/how-toget-html5-working-in-ie-and-firefox-2/]( http://html5doctor.com/how-toget-html5-working-in-ie-and-firefox-2/) has dealt with.

We don't propose to compose an exhaustive list of these behaviours; they are temporary problems that we expect to quickly disappear as new browser versions come out and users upgrade to them.

When to use the new HTML5 structural elements

We've used these elements to mark up our page, and styled them, and although the use of each might seem to be self-evident from the names, it's time to study them in a little more detail.

<header>

In our example above, as on most sites, the header will be the first element on a page. It contains the title of the site, logos, links back to the home page, and so on. The spec says:

"The header element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids . . . Note: A header element is intended to usually contain the section's heading (an h1–h6 element or an hgroup element), but this is not required. The header element can also be used to wrap a section's table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos."

Let's dissect this. The first thing to note is that a <header> element is not required; in our example above, it's superfluous as it surrounds just the <h1>. Its value is that it groups "introductory or navigational" elements, so here's a more realistic example:

<header>

<a href="/"><img src=logo.png alt="home"></a> <h1>My interesting blog</h1>

</header>

Many websites have a title and a tagline or subtitle. To mask the subtitle from the outlining algorithm (so making the main heading and subtitle into one logical unit; see Chapter 2 for more discussion), the main heading and subtitle can be grouped in the new <hgroup> element:

<header>

<a href="/"><img src=logo.png alt="home"></a> <hgroup>

<h1>My interesting blog</h1>

<h2>Tedium, dullness and monotony</h2> </hgroup>

</header>

{{figure 1.6
Figure 1.6 Header for[ www.thaicookery.co.uk]( www.thaicookery.co.uk).
}}

The header can also contain navigation. This can be very useful for site-wide navigation, especially on template-driven sites where the whole of the <header> element could come from a template file. So, for example, the horizontal site-wide navigation on[ www.thaicookery.co.uk]( www.thaicookery.co.uk) could be coded as shown. You can see the result in Figure 1.6.

<header>

 <hgroup>

<h1>Thai Cookery School</h1>

<h2>Learn authentic Thai cookery in your own home.</h2> </hgroup>

<nav>

<ul>

<li>Home</li>

<li><a href="courses.html">Cookery Courses</a></li> <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>

</ul> </nav>

</header>

Of course, it's not required that the <nav> be in the <header>. The Thai cookery example could just as easily be marked up with the main <nav> outside the <header>:

<header>

 <hgroup>

<h1>Thai Cookery School></h1>

<h2>Learn authentic Thai cookery in your own home.</h2> </hgroup>

</header>

<nav>

<ul>

<li>Home</li>

<li><a href="courses.html">Cookery Courses</a></li> <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>

</ul> </nav>

It depends largely on whether you believe that site-wide navigation belongs in the site-wide header, and also on pragmatic considerations about ease of styling. Take, for example, my personal site, which has a very long site-wide navigation on the left of the content area, which can be much longer than a post. Putting this <nav> in the <header> would make it very hard to put the main content in the right place and have a footer, so in this case, the site-wide navigation is outside the <header>, and is a sibling child of the <body>, as in this example (Figure 1.7).

{{figure 1.7
Figure 1.7 Typical page with site-wide navigation out of the main header area.
}}

Note that currently we're creating only the main <header> for the page; there can be multiple <header>s--we'll come to that in Chapter 2.

<nav>

The <nav> element is designed to mark up navigation. Navigation is defined as links around a page (for example, a table of contents at the top of an article that links to anchor points on the same page) or within a site. But not every collection of links is <nav>; a list of sponsored links isn't <nav>, and neither is a page of search results, as that is the main content of the page.

16

To <nav> or not to <nav>?

I was previously guilty of navitis--the urge to surround any links to other parts of a site as <nav>.

I cured myself of it by considering who will benefit from use of the <nav> element. We've previously speculated about a shortcut that would allow an assistive technology user to jump to navigation menus. If there are dozens of <nav>s, it will make it hard for the user to find the most important ones. So I now advocate marking up only the most important nav blocks, such as those that are site-wide (or section-wide) or tables of contents for long pages.

A good rule of thumb is to use a <nav> element if you could imagine the links you're considering wrapping having a heading "Navigation" above them. If they are important enough to merit a heading (regardless of whether the content or design actually requires such a heading), they're important enough to be <nav>.

As the spec says, "Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element--the element is primarily intended for sections that consist of major navigation blocks."

Conversely, the spec suggests that the "legal" links (copyright, contact, freedom of information, privacy policies, and so on). that are often tucked away in the footer should not be wrapped in a <nav>: "It is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site, such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page. The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases; while a nav element can be used in such cases, it is usually unnecessary."

We advise you to ignore what the spec says--use <nav> for these. Many sites also include a link to accessibility information that explains how to request information in alternate formats, for example. Typically, people who require such information are those who would benefit the most from user agents that can take them directly to elements marked up as <nav>.

As with <header>s and <footer>s (and all of the new elements), you're not restricted to one <nav> per page. You might very well have site-wide <nav> in a header, a <nav> which is a table of contents for the current article, and a <nav> below that which links to other related articles on your site.

The contents of a <nav> element will probably be a list of links, marked up as an unordered list (which has become a tradition since Mark Newhouse's seminal "CSS Design: Taming Lists" (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/) or, in the case of breadcrumb trails, an ordered list. Note that the <nav> element is a wrapper; it doesn't replace the <ol> or <ul> element but wraps around it. That way, legacy browsers that don't understand the element will just see the list element and list items and behave themselves just fine.

{{figure 1.8
Figure 1.8 My blog sidebar, (once upon a time) mixing navigation with colophon information and pictures of hunks.
}}

> Before you throw down this book in disgust at my changing my mind, it's important to emphasise that there is rarely One True __WayTM__ to mark up content. HTML is a general language without a million elements to cover all eventualities (it just feels that way sometimes)!

While it makes sense to use a list (and it gives you more hooks for CSS), it's not mandatory. This is perfectly valid:

<nav>

<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>

<p><a href="/about">About</a></p>

</nav>

You can include headings for navigation, too:

<nav>

 <h2>Pages</h2>

 <ul>

<li><a href="/about">About me</a></li>

<li><a href="/news">News</a></li> </ul>

 <h2>Categories</h2>

 <ul>

<li><a href="/happy">Happy Pirates</a></li>

<li><a href="/angry">Angry Pirates</a></li> </ul>

</nav>

Grouping <nav> and other elements in a sidebar

Many sites have a sidebar that includes multiple blocks of navigation and other non-navigation content. Take, for example, my personal site[ www.brucelawson.co.uk]( www.brucelawson.co.uk) (Figure 1.8).

The sidebar on the left of the main content has one nav area containing sublists for pages, categories, archives, and most recent comments. In the first edition of this book, I recommended that these be marked up as a series of consecutive <nav> elements; I've changed my mind and now surround the sublists with one overarching <nav>. (If you have two or more blocks of important navigation that are not consecutive, by all means use separate <nav> elements.)

All my main site navigation is contained in an <aside> element that "can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page" (http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/semantics.html# the-aside-element).

<aside>

 <nav>

<h2>Pages</h2> <ul> .. </ul>

<h2>Categories</h2> <ul> .. </ul>

<h2>Recent comments</h2> <ul> ... </ul>

</nav>

 </section>

</aside>

Note that the "blah blah" section is not marked up as <nav>, as the link to my web host, a picture of me, and two RSS links don't seem to me to be a "section that consist[s] of major navigation blocks" as the spec defines <nav>. It's wrapped in a <section> so that the sidebar headings remain the same level in the outlining algorithm (see Chapter 2 for more information).

<footer>

The <footer> element is defined in the spec as representing "a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element." ("Sectioning content" includes article, aside, nav, and section, and "sectioning root elements" are blockquote, body, details, fieldset, figure, and td.)

Note that, as with the header element, there can be more than one footer on a page; we'll revisit that in Chapter 2. For now, we have just one footer on the page that is a child of the body element. As the spec says, "When the nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element is the body element, then it applies to the whole page."

The spec continues, "A footer typically contains information about its section, such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like."

Our footer holds copyright data, which we're wrapping in a <small> element, too. <small> has been redefined in HTML5; previously it was a presentational element, but in HTML5 it has semantics, representing side comments or small print that "typically features disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. Small print is also sometimes used for attribution, or for satisfying licensing requirements."

Your site's footer probably has more than a copyright notice. You might have links to privacy policies, accessibility information (why are you hiding that out of the way?), and other such links. I'd suggest wrapping these in <nav>, despite the spec's advice (see previous <nav> section).

The spec says "Some site designs have what is sometimes referred to as 'fat footers'--footers that contain a lot of material, including images, links to other articles, links to pages for sending feedback, special offers . . . in some ways, a whole 'front page' in the footer." It suggests a <nav> element, within the <footer>, to enclose the information.

When tempted to use a "fat footer," consider whether such links actually need <nav> at all--navitis can be hard to shake off. Also ask yourself whether such links are actually part of a <footer> at all: would it be better as an <aside> of the whole page, a sibling of <footer>?

<article>

The main content of this blog's home page contains a few blog posts. We wrap each one up in an <article> element. <article> is specified thus: "A self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content."

A blog post, a tutorial, a news story, comic strip, or a video with its transcript all fit perfectly into this definition. Less intuitively, this definition also works for individual emails in a web-based

email client, maps, and reusable web widgets. For <article> don't think newspaper article, think article of clothing--a discrete item. Note that, as with <nav>, the heading is part of the article itself, so it goes inside the element. Thus

<h1>My article</h1> <article>

<p>Blah blah</p> </article>

is incorrect; it should be

<article>

<h1>My article</h1> <p>Blah blah</p>

</article>

There are many more interesting facets to <article> which

(you've guessed it) we'll look at in the next chapter.

What's the point?

A very wise friend of mine, Robin Berjon, wrote, "Pretty much everyone in the Web community agrees that 'semantics are yummy, and will get you cookies,' and that's probably true. But once you start digging a little bit further, it becomes clear that very few people can actually articulate a reason why.

"The general answer is 'to repurpose content.' That's fine on the surface, but you quickly reach a point where you have to ask, 'Repurpose to what?' For instance, if you want to render pages to a small screen (a form of repurposing) then <nav> or <footer> tell you that those bits aren't content, and can be folded away; but if you're looking into legal issues digging inside <footer> with some heuristics won't help much . . .

"I think HTML should add only elements that either expose functionality that would be pretty much meaningless otherwise (e.g., <canvas>) or that provide semantics that help repurpose for Web browsing uses."[ www.alistapart.com/comments/]( www.alistapart.com/comments/) semanticsinhtml5?page=2#12

As Robin suggests, small screen devices might fold away noncontent areas (or zoom in to the main content areas). A certain touch or swipe could zoom to nav, or to footer or header. A

Summary

search engine could weight links in a footer less highly than links in a nav bar. There are many future uses that we can't guess at--but they all depend on unambiguously assigning meaning to content, which is the definition of semantic markup.

In this chapter, we've taken our first look at HTML5 and its DOCTYPE. We've structured the main landmarks of a web page using <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <aside>, and <article>, providing user agents with more semantics than the meaningless generic <div> element that was our only option in HTML 4, and styled the new elements with the magic of CSS.

We've seen its forgiving syntax rules such as optional uppercase/lowercase, quoting and attribute minimisation, omitting implied elements like head/body, omitting standard stuff like type="text/javascript" and type="text/css" on the <script>, and <style> tags and we've even shown you how to tame the beast of old IE versions. Not bad for one chapter, eh?
