# Drag and Drop

So we've come to the black sheep chapter of our book: drag and drop. It's not a black sheep in that cool way, like Darth Vader's version of the Imperial TIE Fighter; no, sadly it's the black sheep you want to leave alone in a field, and let it do its own thing. Some better men have even worse things to say about the spec.

So why is it here? Why is it in the HTML5 spec--and yes, drag and drop actually is part of the real HTML5 spec. Well, it's here because Microsoft Internet Explorer added drag and drop back in 1999 in IE5--yep, that long ago. Since then, Safari had implemented IE's API, so Ian Hickson, the HTML5 editor, reverse engineered the API, did all the hard work to understand exactly what was going on (describing the MSDN documentation as having a "vague hand-wavy description"), and documented the API.

> Go to [http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1115899732&count=1](http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1115899732&count=1) to see details of Hickson's investigation.

Now we're in the position where Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and IE support this API. It's not a good API--in fact, it's probably the worst API--but it's got some real-world implementations, so it's worth understanding what it's capable of.

Throughout this chapter, you'll be forgiven for exclaiming "WTF?" as we wind our way through the rabbit's warren that is the dragand-drop API and look at some of the interesting functionality that it can bring to your applications. This API, as its name implies, allows you to drag items and drop them anywhere in the browser. But this functionality is not limited to the browser. You can drag elements from the browser to external applications--like another browser window, or Photoshop, or a text editor--and the application can prepare the dragged data so that it's compatible with the drop target. This lends itself very well to the idea that HMTL5 is a web applications spec, and is giving us developers more functionality that borrows from desktop computing.

## Getting into drag

{{figure 8.1

Figure 8.1 All images and links are draggable by default. With a little more code, you can make them droppable too.

}}

Let's start with the absolute minimum required to achieve the wonder that is dragging and dropping. By default, all links, text nodes (or selections of text), and image elements are draggable. This means that you don't have to do anything to tell the browser that these things can be dragged around the page.

Our simple demo will have a drop zone and a couple of images that you can drag into the drop zone. And when you drop them, the image source will appear in the drop zone (Figure 8.1).


Since there's nothing to be done to the draggable images, you just need to hook up the drop zone, which requires the following event handlers:

1. Drag over: Tells the browser this is an element that accepts drop data.

2. On drop: Once something has been dropped on the element, the browser does something with the dropped data.

> As used in this sec-tion, "drop zone" simply means a place that a user drops something. I am not referring to the recently added W3C attribute dropzone discussed in the sidebar "Native drop zones" later in this chapter.

I'm explaining the absolute minimum required to achieve drag and drop, but this minimum method will only work in Safari. I'll then walk you through the tweaks required to get it to work in Firefox, Chrome, and IE.

The other thing worth mentioning is that the specification up on[[[ http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd]( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd)]([ http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd]( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd))]([[ http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd]( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd)]([ http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd]( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#dnd))) says that there are three events you need to handle drag and drop. That isn't the case, at least certainly not in practice. You need three events to get it working in all browsers, except for Firefox and Safari.

Let's put all these caveats aside for a minute and crack on with our demo. The following listing is the über-minimalistic source you need to see the drag-and-drop API in action:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Simple drag demo</title>
<style>
#drop { height: 100px; border: 5px solid #ccc; }
</style>
<img src="http://img.tweetimag.es/i/rem" alt="@rem">
<img src="http://img.tweetimag.es/i/brucel" alt="@brucel">
<div id="drop"></div>
<script>
var drop = document.getElementById('drop');
drop.ondrop = function (event) {
  this.innerHTML += '<p>' + event.dataTransfer.getData('Text') + '</p>';
};
drop.ondragover = function () { return false; };
</script>
```

I'm using the minimal HTML required just to keep things short. You can see from the previous code that I'm grabbing a reference to the `div#drop` element and then setting two inline event handlers: ondrop and `ondragover`.

When something is dropped on the drop element, it triggers the drop event and you're able to read the `event.dataTransfer` object. The default data type is Text, so you can use the `getData` method and ask for the Text data type. In the case of an image, the text will be the source of the image (typically IE gives us `null` for the Text data type, but you'll fix that later). For links, the href is the set data and for plain text that's been selected and dragged, the text itself is the set data.

Here's where it starts to get a little strange. To tell the browser that the drop element can accept items being dropped on it, you need to *cancel* the dragover event. Since I'm using an inline event handler (namely `ondragover`) I can return false. This prevents the default browser action. What is the default action? It's unclear from the spec, but it would be fair to say the default action would be to leave the object in the control of the browser. If I were using `addEventListener`, I would have to use `event.preventDefault()`.

So that you're completely clear--because, frankly, it's not terribly obvious--here's a quote from the spec:

*"If the drop is to be accepted, then this event (dragover) has to be canceled."*

So now that you've got your first drag and drop working, what about those tweaks I mentioned? Let's fix Firefox first; this is easy. When you drop the image on the drop zone in Firefox, it actually redirects the browser off to the value of `getData('Text')` for you if it looks like a link--that is, image sources and link hrefs. So that's easy: In the drop event, you prevent the browser's default action. If you're using inline handlers, you'll return false, or `event.preventDefault()`, so our drop handler now looks like this:

```js
drop.ondrop = function (event) {
  this.innerHTML += '<p>' + event.dataTransfer.getData('Text') + '</p>';
  return false;
};
```

Now, IE. Getting it working in IE isn't actually as painful as it could be. This is most likely because they came up with the

API in the first place. IE doesn't listen to the dropover event, it listens for the dropenter event--and it's this event you need to cancel for IE to play ball. So let's add another event handler and `return false`, too. Since you're doing the same thing, I've created a function to `return false`:

```js
function cancelEvent() { return false; }
drop.ondragenter = cancelEvent;
drop.ondragover = cancelEvent;
```

Again, since you're making it work in IE, IE doesn't pass in the event object to our inline handler, so you need to change the drop event handle to grab the global event object if you didn't receive one.

You also need to cancel the event from bubbling up the DOM to prevent new windows opening. Typically return false should handle this (as it does in the other browsers), but IE needs a helping hand with `event.cancelBubble=true`.

```js
drop.ondrop = function (event) {
  event = event || window.event;
  this.innerHTML += '<p>' + event.dataTransfer.getData('Text') + '</p>';
  event.cancelBubble = true;
  return false;
};
```

One final issue to fix: When you drop the image in IE or Chrome, you get "null" as the text in our drop zone. To fix this you need to set some data under the Text data type once the element starts to drag, using the dragstart event:

```
var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName('img'),
    i = imgs.length;

while (i--) {
  imgs[i].ondragstart = function (event) {
    event = event || window.event;
    event.dataTransfer.setData('Text', this.getAttribute('alt'));
  };
}
```

Now you can see that I've set some data whose type is "Text" based on the alt attribute on the image. Now when the image is dropped, and the Text data type is read, you'll get the Twitter screen names instead of the image source. This drag-and-drop demo works in IE5 onwards, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. More importantly, it's the `setData` method that really shows off the possibilities of the drag-and-drop model, but equally exposes some potential issues in the specification.

## Interoperability of dragged data

By using the `setData` and `getData` methods on the `dataTransfer` object, we can pass data from elements inside our applica-tion to other pages of our app, or across browser windows--as 280 Slides has prototyped, when dragging one slide from one window to another completely separate document (Figure 8.2). You can also accept or send data to native desktop applications.

{{figure 8.2

}}

### Dragging data to other applications

So long as you know what the accepted content types are, you can set the data type to accept that particular content type. For example, on a Macintosh, it's possible to drag text snippets to the desktop. I can construct my own content, set the content type to text/plain, and when I drag the text to the desktop, a text snippet is created with my content (Figure 8.3):

```js
img.ondragstart = function (event) {
  event = event || window.event;
  // here be one long line
  event.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain',
    'This is the screen name for ' +
    this.getAttribute('data-screen_name') +
    ', whose image can be found here: ' +
    this.src);
};
```

One final note about `setData`: It only accepts strings. This means you can't store a "complex" JavaScript object in a content type. However, there's an easy enough solution around this: `JSON.stringify`.

All the latest browsers ship with native JSON encoding (stringify) and decoding (parse), so you can stringify our complex object and set it against a content type. For the older browsers you can include the JSON library from [http://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) which will plug support for JSON stringify and parse.

### Problems with setting drag data

Native desktop applications have had drag and drop for some time now and have had years to get the APIs right. One huge advantage that native applications have is that the setting of data doesn't actually happen, or execute, when the user starts dragging. It happens when the user drops.

There is an important reason for this: When you drop, you need only one content type.

> In total, there're seven drag-and-drop events. You've seen `dragenter`, `dragover`, `drop`, and `dragstart`. The others are `dragend` (the complement to `dragstart`), `dragenter`, and `dragleave`. The enter and leave events fire on the drop zone as the dragged item enters the element.

Having to construct the different content types on the dragstart event makes you perform possibly unnecessary code execution. For example, if I were to allow the user to drag a canvas element to Photoshop, I would want to encode it as a Photoshop-compatible file and store it in the correct content type. But what if I'm also supporting other formats along with Photoshop? I'd have to do all that encoding at the point in which the dragstart event fires, but the user will, at best, only drop it on a single application. What if they're just dragging the element around to play? You've still run all that execution, a huge waste of processing for more complicated applications. If your application is simple, you may not see any performance issues; but if it's a full-fledged application, you need to consider your options. Perhaps you don't support all those formats. Perhaps you support only one compatible format. Perhaps you don't even support drag and drop.

There are proposals to fix this (along with proposals to scrap the entire drag-and-drop model and start again), but for the medium term, this is a problem you'll have to work around.

## How to drag any element

This is where the HTML5 spec added some new content to the API. Enabling any element to be dragged is incredibly easy. Take your div and add the new attribute: draggable. For example:

```html
<div draggable="true">This element be draggable</div>
```

Of course I said incredibly easy. Well, it works in Firefox; any element that has the draggable attribute can now be dragged around the browser. Of course, since it's a new addition in HTML5, it doesn't come as standard in IE, so forget about it working there. Perhaps it will work in IE9 or later. More incredible is getting it to work in Safari 4.

Although it's blindingly simple to enable any element to be draggable using the draggable attribute, for reasons that are

still beyond this author and many other bloggers, to get any element to drag in Safari 4 you need to give it a specific CSS style. That's right, to enable a behaviour you need to define a presentational attribute. This has been fixed in Safari 5 so the CSS isn't required, but for older Safari versions you'll need the following CSS to target elements with the draggable attribute:

```
[draggable] { -webkit-user-drag: element; }
```

{{aside

Native Drop zones

No, we're not talking about the place where local parachutists land. There's a new dropzone attribute available in the drag-and-drop specification. This can be applied to the area that you want to drop data onto. The attribute accepts the following values: copy (the default), move, and link which control the feedback to the dragged item. In addition to the feedback value, you can also include the accepted kinds of data the drop zone supports. For example:

<div dropzone="copy s:text/plain f:image/png"> Drop 'em on my head </div>

This would allow my script to copy any dragged content whose content type was either plain text or a PNG image. The 's:' stands for string and 'f:' stands for file. Currently nothing else is supported in the spec.

I suspect that the idea is to remove the need for the dragover and dragenter shenanigans. However, as there's absolutely no current browser support for this feature, I can't be entirely sure. It's certainly a move in the right direction toward enhancing and simplifying the drag and drop API, but until we see it land in a browser, I'm afraid this is just a glimpse of what drag and drop should be, rather than being useful today!

}}

This uses the CSS attribute selector (the square brackets) to find all the elements with the draggable property enabled, and then applies the behaviour to enable the user to drag the element.

Aside from the CSS fudge that you have to add to kick Safari 4 into life, dragging any element isn't too hard, and it means you can now create complicated objects in the DOM that the user can move around and drop into other windows or applications.

## Adding custom drag icons

You can add your own custom drag icon when dragging an element. On the dragstart event, you can use the `setDragImage` method to associate your own image with the cursor at a specific offset to the regular cursor image.

There is, of course, a small caveat: It doesn't work in IE, and in Safari, you can't override the cursor if dragging text, images, or links. But we're optimistic--let's create our own custom drag icon:

```js
var dragIcon = document.createElement('img');
// set the drag icon to the mini twitter logo
dragIcon.src = 'http://img.tweetimag.es/i/twitter_m'; // later in the code...
element.ondragstart = function (event) {
  event.dataTransfer.setDragImage(dragIcon, -10, -10);
  // and do some other interesting stuff with dataTransfer
};
```

The result is a nice little bespoke drag icon that better represents the data you're moving around (Figure 8.4). To keep things consistent with the madness that is the Drag and Drop specification, the coordinate system for the drag image is the inverse of what you'd expect. Since all (or all that I can think of) web technology coordinate systems work with the centre point being the top left, you might think that setting a negative offset would put the drag image -10 up and -10 left. No, in fact you'd be wrong, obviously... it actually puts the image 10 below and 10 to the right. Really the rule of thumb with Drag and Drop is: all bets are off.

{{figure 8.4

## Accessibility

If you've made it this far undeterred by the warnings and dead bodies throughout this specification, then hopefully the application with drag and drop that you're implementing will come under the question of accessibility. Is the drag and drop API accessible, or can I make it accessible?

Well, as you'd expect with this specification, there's a good intention. So yes, the API has been designed with accessibility in mind. It's not terribly clear, but the latest thinking is that the user should be able to control dragging and dropping using the keyboard copy and paste model.

The process is supposed to be: Navigate to the element you want to drag, copy to the clipboard using the keyboard shortcuts, and then navigate to the drop zone, and paste using the keyboard.

As you've probably already guessed, no browser has implemented this (yet).

However, you can prepare your drag-and-drop demos by including ARIA support. You will need to set ARIA attributes on `dragstart` to indicate that the element is being dragged.

We also need to now bind to the `dragend` event to remove the ARIA attribute. We should also use visual cues to indicate to the user what elements can be dragged and where they can be dropped. I'm not going to cover this detail, but Gez Lemon wrote a detailed article on adding ARIA and general accessibility to nonnative drag and drop, but the advice also applies to the native drag and drop provided by this API:[ http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/accessible-drag-and-drop/]( http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/accessible-drag-and-drop/)

```js
var drop = document.getElementById('drop'),
    boxes = document.getElementsByTagName('div'),
    i = boxes.length;

while (i--) {
  if (boxes[i].getAttribute('draggable') != undefined) {
    boxes[i].ondragstart = function (event) {
      event = event || window.event;
      this.setAttribute('aria-grabbed', 'true');
      // set the drop targets up for ARIA support
      drop.tabIndex = 0; // for keyboard support
      drop.setAttribute('aria-dropeffect', 'copy');
      // then do something fancy with dataTranfer.setData
    };

    boxes[i].ondragend = function () {
      this.setAttribute('aria-grabbed', 'false');
      // reset the drop targets
      drop.tabIndex = -1; // for keyboard support
      drop.removeAttribute('aria-dropeffect');
    };

    boxes[i].tabIndex = 0; // for keyboard support
    boxes[i].setAttribute('aria-grabbed', 'false');
  }
}
```

## Summary

In the previous code, you're searching for the divs that have the draggable attribute. Then you add the ARIA support starting in the dragstart event. Once the element begins to drag, you set the aria-grabbed attribute to true, so that an assistive device can feedback. You're also now making the drop zone an element that can accept keyboard focus using `tabIndex = 0` and finally you're saying the drop effect should be 'copy'. You could mirror the `allowedEffect` and `dropEffect` in the native drag and drop, but for now you'll remain focused on the ARIA support.

Next, you add the new dragend event handler, and once the element is no longer being dragged, you remove the aria-grabbed attribute and reset the drop zone attributes, that is, no `tabIndex` and no `dropEffect`. Lastly, you initialise the draggable element by setting the `tabIndex` and the aria-grabbed flag.

With this code, users can move around your application and its drag-and-drop components, and their screenreaders (if they support ARIA) will feed back the current state of the operation.

However--and this is a big however--since no browser has implemented the keyboard support for native drag and drop, you will most likely have to consider rolling your own drag and drop using JavaScript to handle everything--a rather sad ending to what is a particularly common operation on the Web.

The drag and drop API isn't in a great state and can be difficult to implement across all the browsers your application may support. In fact, you may have to fall back to an old-school JavaScript based solution to drag and drop where the support is lacking.

However, native drag and drop, combined with newer APIs like the File API (out of the scope of this book, but it allows the browser to read files directly from within JavaScript, without the need for any submission and interaction with the server) allows users to drag files straight into the browser. This functionality is appearing as beta features in applications such as Gmail, allowing users with browsers that support the bleeding edge drag and drop API, if there is such a thing, to experience the very latest technology. Beyond browser support, accessibility is another big hurdle at the moment.

You'll need to carefully consider whether native drag and drop is the right choice for your application.
