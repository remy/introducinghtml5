# Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to coauthor-turned-friend Remy Sharp, and friendturned-ruthless-tech-editor Patrick Lauke: il miglior fabbro. At New Riders, Michael Nolan, Margaret Anderson, Gretchen Dykstra, and Jan Seymour deserve medals for their hard work and their patience.

Thanks to the Opera Developer Relations Team, particularly the editor of dev.opera.com, Chris Mills, for allowing me to reuse some materials I wrote for him, Daniel Davis for his description of `<ruby>`, Shwetank Dixit for checking some drafts, and David Storey for being so knowledgeable about Web Standards and generously sharing that knowledge. Big shout to former team member Henny Swan for her support and lemon cake. Elsewhere in Opera, the specification team of James Graham, Lachlan Hunt, Philip Jägenstedt, Anne van Kesteren, and Simon Pieters checked chapters and answered 45,763 daft questions with good humour. Nothing in this book is the opinion of Opera Software ASA.

Ian Hickson has also answered many a question, and my fellow HTML5 doctors (www.html5doctor.com) have provided much insight and support.

Many thanks to Richard Ishida for explaining `<bdi>` to me and allowing me to reproduce his explanation. Also to Aharon Lanin. Smoochies to Robin Berjon and the Mozilla Developer Center who allowed me to quote them.

Thanks to Gez Lemon and mighty Steve Faulkner for advice on WAI-ARIA. Thanks to Denis Boudreau, Adrian Higginbotham, Pratik Patel, Gregory J. Rosmaita, and Léonie Watson for screen reader advice.

Thanks to Stuart Langridge for drinkage, immoral support, and suggesting the working title "HTML5 Utopia." Mr. Last Week's creative vituperation provided loadsalaffs. Thanks, whoever you are.

Thanks to John Allsopp, Tantek Çelik, Christian Heilmann, John Foliot, Jeremy Keith, Matt May, and Eric Meyer for conversations about the future of markup. Silvia Pfeiffer's blog posts on multimedia were invaluable to my understanding.

Stu Robson braved IE6 to take the screenshot in Chapter 1, Terence Eden took the BlackBerry screenshots in Chapter 3, Julia Gosling took the photo of Remy's magic HTML5 moustache in Chapter 4, and Jake Smith provided valuable feedback on early drafts of my chapters. Lastly, but most importantly, thanks to the thousands of students, conference attendees, and Twitter followers for their questions and feedback.

This book is in memory of my grandmothers, Marjorie Whitehead, 8 March 1917–28 April 2010, and Elsie Lawson 6 June 1920–20 August 2010.

This book is dedicated to Nongyaw, Marina, and James, without whom life would be monochrome.

Über thanks to Bruce who invited me to coauthor this book and without whom I would have spent the early part of 2010 complaining about the weather instead of writing this book. On that note, I'd also like to thank Chris Mills for even recommending me to Bruce.

To Robert Nyman, my technical editor: when I was in need of someone to challenge my JavaScript, I knew there would always be a Swede at hand. Thank you for making sure my code was as sound as it could be. Equally to Patrick Lauke, who also whipped some of my code, and certainly parts of my English, into shape.

Thanks to the local Brighton cafés, Coffee@33 and Café Délice, for letting me spend so many hours writing this book and drinking your coffee.

To my local Brighton digital community and new friends who have managed to keep me both sane and insane over the last few years of working alone. Thank you to Danny Hope, Josh Russell, and Anna Debenham for being my extended colleagues.

Thank you to Jeremy Keith for letting me rant and rail over HTML5 and bounce ideas, and for encouraging me to publish my thoughts. Equal thanks to Jessica for letting us talk tech over beers!

To the HTML5 Doctors and Rich Clark in particular for inviting me to contribute--and also to the team for publishing such great material.

To the whole #jquery-ot channel for their help when I needed to debug, or voice my frustration over a problem, and for being someplace I could go rather than having to turn to my cats for JavaScript support.

To the #whatwg channel for their help when I had misinterpreted the specification and needed to be put back on the right path. In particular to Anne Van Kesteren, who seemed to always have the answers I was looking for, perhaps hidden under some secret rock I'm yet to discover.

To all the conference organisers that invited me to speak, to the conference goers that came to hear me ramble, to my Twitter followers that have helped answer my questions and helped spur me on to completing this book with Bruce: thank you. I've tried my best with the book, and if there's anything incorrect or out of date: blame Bruce buy the next edition. ;-)

To my wife, Julie: thank you for supporting me for all these many years. You're more than I ever deserved and without you, I honestly would not be the man I am today.

Finally, this book is dedicated to Tia. My girl. I wrote the majority of my part of this book whilst you were on our way to us. I always imagined that you'd see this book and be proud and equally embarrassed. That won't happen now, and even though you're gone, you'll always be with us and never forgotten.

--Remy Sharp
